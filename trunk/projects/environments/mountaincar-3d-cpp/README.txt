=================================
Mountain Car 3D
=================================

This project contains the 3D version of the Mountain Car Environment.
It is based on source code created by Matthew Taylor (http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mtaylor/dissertation/)

The 3D extension of the Mountain Car was originally introduced by Matthew
Taylor, Gregory Kuhlmann and Peter Stone (Autonomous transfer for reinforcement learning. In The Seventh International Joint
Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, 2008).

=================================
Building instructions
=================================

It is required to have installed the RL-Glue library (version 3.0).

To compile the environment just use the g++ compiler (or any ANSI C++
compiler) giving the following command:

$> make

If your installation of RL-Glue or the RL-Glue C/C++ codec is not in your header and library search path, you may need to edit the Makefile with LDFLAGS and CFLAGS
pointing to your headers and libraries.  There are instructions on how to do this
inside the Makefile.
