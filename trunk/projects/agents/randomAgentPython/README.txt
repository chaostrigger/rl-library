====================
NOTE
THIS AGENT IS CURRENTLY BROKEN AND NOT COMPATIBLE WITH RL-GLUE 3
====================

This python agent is meant to select random actions for any RL-Glue domain whose actions are properly characterized by a valid task spec.  It can handle multi-dimensional discrete and continuous actions. This agent does not learn.

Python is interpreted so you do not need to rebuild this agent if you change the source.

$> ./run.bash:
- Starts the randomAgentPython process

You need to start an experiment separately.

Note: This agent CAN be dynamically loaded by RL-Viz experiments.
