== The Communication Protocol
===============================

At each time step, the RL-GLue agent receives a series of integers that 
describes the state of the world as perceived by the collection of units.  

The first integer is a global piece of information, the amount of minerals
available to your empire. Minerals are monetary funds; they are used to 
build units. 

The remaining integers represent a set of units, where units are always 
described by a constant number of integers, described below: 

  0. type 
        worker = 0
        marine = 1
        base = 2
        mineral patch = 3
  1. id
  2. owner of this unit (player id). 
      (RL player is always player id 1, opponent is 0)
  3. x-coordinate of current position
  4. y-coordinate of current position
  5. radius of unit
  6. sight range of unit
  7. hit points
  8. armor
  9. max_speed 
       if non-mobile unit, this value is meaningless
  10. is moving
       0 = false
       1 = true
       if non-mobile unit, this value is meaningless
  11. amount of minerals carrying
       if non-worker unit, this value is meaningless

This data must be parsed into a world state object upon arrival. 

At each step, the action taken by the agent is simply the composition of 
actions for each individual unit, executed simultaneously. 

Each action is also a sequence of integers. The overall action is the 
sequence obtained by concatenating all of the action sequences, in any 
order. Each action has the form: 

  0. unit id
  1. action type
       move = 0
       build base = 1
       stop = 2
       train worker = 3
       train marine = 4
       attack = 5
  2. target x-coordinate
       if unit is non-mobile, value is meaningless
  3. target y-coordinate
       if unit is non-mobile, value is meaningless
  4. speed
       if unit is non-mobile, value is meaningless
  5. training type or target id
       (currently used only for target id in attack actions)
