svn copy -m "Create branch to work in issue 3" https://rl-glue.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ https://rl-glue.googlecode.com/svn/branches/ISSUE-3

Now we want to make a tag for this issue

svn copy -m "Tag start of issue 3" https://rl-glue.googlecode.com/svn/branches/ISSUE-3 https://rl-glue.googlecode.com/svn/tags/PRE-3

Ok, I'm going to "switch" to this branch and work on the issue.  I'll report back how it works out.

svn switch https://rl-glue.googlecode.com/svn/branches/ISSUE-3

svn copy -m "Tag end of issue 3 - fixed" https://rl-glue.googlecode.com/svn/branches/ISSUE-3 https://rl-glue.googlecode.com/svn/tags/POST-3

Switch back to working on the trunk

svn switch https://rl-glue.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

Apply the changes between the two tags to the trunk
svn merge https://rl-glue.googlecode.com/svn/tags/PRE-3 https://rl-glue.googlecode.com/svn/tags/POST-3
