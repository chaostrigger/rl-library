This example is to show how RL-Glue can be used when directly compiling an agent, environment, and experiment all written in C together with the glue. The direct compilation process provides an advantage in speed and simplicity. This example includes a SarsaAgent and a mines environment (as well as a generic sample experiment program). To compile the project and run it you need to type make in your terminal. This causes the script in the makefile to run and compile the project. An executable will appear in your bin/ folder now called RL_glue. Run this by typing ./RL_glue and the sample experiment should begin. 

You can edit the makefile to adjust this experiment however you like (or copy the makefile for your own projects). In the makefile you can change the compiler by changing the CC variable. You can remove or add any compiler flags you like (CFLAGS) however you must leave in -I$(RL-GLUE) so the compiler knows to look for code in the RL-Glue directory. If you move this experiment folder to another part of your computer, ensure your RL-GLUE variable in the makefile still points to where the RL-Glue directory is located. 

Good luck! Feel free to modify and borrow bits of this code for your own agents, environments and experiments.
