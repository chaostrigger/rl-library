This is the *new* RL-Library.  Still under construction, as should be obvious from the extreme lack of agents and environments.

However, if you want to get started, by all means, you should!

To build all of the agents, environments, and rl-glue, type:
$>ant all

Note: You need to have apache ant installed:
http://ant.apache.org/

Then, to run a simple test that uses dynamic loading and visualization, do:
$>cd scripts
$>bash runNet.bash

Good luck!
