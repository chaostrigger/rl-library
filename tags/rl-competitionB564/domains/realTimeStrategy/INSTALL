Real Time Strategy Domain Installation Instructions
=====================================================
ortslite is a simple stripped-down implementation of an RTS 
(Real-time Strategy) game. 

To compile ortslite: 

  1. Install dependencies:

     - boost >= 1.33

       If running on a Linux system, this is probably already done
       for you. Try building the boost test in misc/boost_test. If it
       compiles and runs, then boost is already installed. If not, then 
       it's likely easily obtained by using your package manager; search
       for packages named "boost" and/or "boost-dev". Otherwise, follow
       instructions below.

        Note: If you are not comfortable installing boost or are not sure 
		what to do next, we have included a script to install it for you.  
		This script will install a local copy of boost, inside the 
		rl-competition software distribution.  You do not need root access to 
		install it.  Be warned, if some files are missing on your computer, 
		you may see a MASSIVE amount of errors when building.  It is probably 
		still working.  Also note, this can take up to 30 minutes.  
		
		To run the script:

$>./scripts/install-boost.bash

		 Or, to manually install boost to your home directory, do the following:
$>cd misc
$>tar xjvf boost_1_34_1.tar.bz2
$>cd boost_1_34_1
$>./configure --prefix=$HOME
$>make
$>make install

       If you see a message indicating that not all the libraries were
       built properly, that is OK. It is likely that the optional python
       libraries were not built. 

       Lastly, create this symbolic link. 

$>cd $HOME/include
$>ln -s boost-1_34_1/boost

       Now, build and run the test program in misc/boost_test to verify
       that it worked. 

     - gawk (only if installing on Linux). 

  2. Set the OSTYPE variable. Supported values are LINUX and DARWIN. It is recommended
     to set this environment variable in your shell's startup script. 

       export OSTYPE="LINUX"

  3. If it's the first time compiling the software:

       make init

  4. Try making the ol app:

       make ol

     This will create bin/ol 

  5.  To make the environment 

$>make rlgenv

	This will create bin/rlgenv

  6.  To make a simple agent:

$>make rlgagent
	
	This will create bin/rlgagent
