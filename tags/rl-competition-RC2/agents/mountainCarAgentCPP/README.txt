This c++ agent implements SARSA(Lambda) control for the MountainCar domain.  This has been specifically implemented for the MountainCar domain and will not work with any other competition domains.



To recompile just the MountainCar c++ agent:
>> make clean
>> make

in mountainCarAgentCPP directory.

run.bash:
- Starts the mountainCarAgentCPP process

You need to start a trainer separately.
