== Important Notes ==
This experiment dynamically loads agents and/or environments from JAR files in your `rl-library/products` directory.
For things to work right, it would be best if you had one of each in there.  We suggest (if you are starting out)  
the [MountainCarJava] environment and [EpsilonGreedyTileCodingSarsaLambdaJava Tile Coding Sarsa Lambda Java] agent. 

This experiment is actually part of the [GraphicalExperimentsWithRLViz graphical experiment getting started guide], so please consult that document for full 
details and explanation.
