Mountain Car 3D
=================================

This project contains the 3D version of the Mountain Car Environment.
It is based on source code created by Matthew Taylor (http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mtaylor/dissertation/)

The 3D extension of the Mountain Car was originally intoduced by Matthew
Taylor, Gregory Kuhlmann and Peter Stone (Autonomous transfer for reinforcement learning. In The Seventh International Joint
Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, 2008).
