  * Changed the warning message if you run an experiment with rl-glue not built from `RL_glue not found at ../../../system/rl-glue/RL-Glue/bin/RL_glue.  Did you remember to *make*  from the main competition directory?` to `RL_glue not found at ../../../system/rl-glue/RL-Glue/bin/RL_glue.  Did you remember to *make rl-glue* or *ant rl-glue* from the rl-glue directory?`

= Release .15 Beta =
  * Added Random Python Agent in projects/agents/randomAgentPython
  * Split the sampleExperimentRLViz run.bash script into 2 scripts
     * One of the scripts runs with dynamic env/agent loading as before
     * The other loads an environment dynamically but lets you run whatever agent you want
  * Move scripts/runNet.bash into projects/experiments/guiExperiment/
     * Split runNet.bash into two scripts, one that dynamically loads env/agents and one that doesn't dynamically load the agent (as above)
  * Updated main README.rtf to this effect
  * Added run.bash script to the Random Java Agent so it can be started on it's own
