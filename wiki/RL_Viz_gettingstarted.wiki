= Environment Variables =

RL-Viz uses several environment variables.

=== AgentShell Variables ===

 * CPPAgent=true|false

This variable specifies if the dynamic agent loader will look for agents in the form of C/C++ shared libraries.

 * RLVIZ_LIB_PATH=/path/to/libraries/

This variable tells the loader where to look for the agentJars/ folder


=== EnvironmentShell Variables ===

 * CPPEnv=true|false

This variable specifies if the dynamic environment loader will look for environments in the form of C/C++ shared libraries.

 * RLVIZ_LIB_PATH=/path/to/libraries/ : this variable tells the loader where to look for the envJars/ folder


To set any of these variables when calling java, use java -Dvarname=varvalue

For example: java -DRLVIZ_LIB_PATH=/users/yourname/rl-library/libraries -DCPPAgent=true
