#summary This is the getting started guide.

= Introduction =

RL-Library is basically a large collection of agents, environments, experiments, and packages that have been shared by members of the reinforcement learning community.

The main thread that links all of these projects together is that they are compatible with [http://glue.rl-community.org RL-Glue].

There are several ways that you could potentially use the RL-Library. We have provided (and will explain below) our vision (the _cohesive view_) of how the different projects in RL-Library can be used together.

However, you can do whatever you like.  You could, for example, just download a particular project so that you can see/improve/change its source code.

= The Cohesive View of RL-Library =
Right now, this only applies to Java projects, because that is mostly what we have in the RL-Library at the moment.

Most Java projects in RL-Library rely on some common scripts, [http://ant.apache.org/ ant buildfiles], and libraries.  Instead of keeping separate copies of all these things in source control (which could be crazy):
<code language="bsh">
#Useful ant scripts go here
rl-library/system/common/ant

#Supporting Libraries (like RL-Glue and RL-Viz go here)
rl-library/system/common/libs

#The JAR files for built java agents/environments go here
rl-library/products
