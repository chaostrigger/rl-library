#summary This is the main page with information about how to download from the RL-Library.

= Introduction =

Because of the large number of downloads associated with the RL-Library project, we have provided some structure that can help you navigate to the project that you're looking for.

The sidebar on the left lists all of the different areas that are currently available.

*NOTE:* Remember that you need to install [http://glue.rl-community.org RL-Glue] before you can use these projects.

If you would like to look at the list of all downloads in the default Google file sorter, that option is available [http://code.google.com/p/rl-library/downloads/list here].
