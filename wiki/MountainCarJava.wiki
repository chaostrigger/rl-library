== Compiling This Environment ==
You must have ANT installed to build this environment using these instructions.

You don't have to compile this, because the JAR file has been compiled
and placed into the products directory already. However, if you want to 
make changes and recompile, you can simply type:
{{{
>$ ant clean
>$ ant build
}}}

== Running This Environment ==
You can run this environment by typing:
{{{
>$ java -jar products/MountainCar.jar
}}}

You can also use it in conjunction with RL-Library by putting the JAR file
products/MountainCar.jar in the appropriate directory, as long as the 
RL-Viz library jar file is in the appropriate relative location from
where you put MountainCar.jar.  The location is:
../system/common/libs/rl-viz/RLVizLib.jar
