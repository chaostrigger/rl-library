#summary This page contains the drafts of the rl-competition software release notes
#labels Phase-Support

== Since Build 552 ==
  * Fixed Helicopter to report the right number of observations (12) in the task spec
  * Update Helicopter Visualizer to only draw 12 variables

== Build 552 ==
  * Fixed bug in C RTS agent behavior

== Build 549 ==

===Mundane (but important) Updates===

    * Vizualizer no longer crashes when the agent/environment loaders find no agent or environments
    * Load button becomes disabled when no environments or agents
    * The speed slider/label only becomes enabled when an experiment is loaded
    * Some updates to RL-Glue, mostly involving Python stuff brought up by alito in the forums
    * Some task spec parsing fixes in RL-Glue
    * Updated RL-Viz so that "load experiment" calls RL_init, resolving a mismatched set of init_cleanup calls when loading/unloading environments immediately (brought up by Brad Knox  in the forums)
    * Add some other sanity checking to RL-Viz to stop weird mismatches
    * Added -source 5 to the javac calls in the Makefiles (brought up by Tarek in the forums)
    * Real Time Strategy environment can now be compiled and loaded as a dynamic C++ library (in testing -- not ready for competition yet)
    * RTS java agent can now be loaded dynamically as a JAR, allowing local running of RTS experiments!(in testing -- not ready for competition yet)
    * Update to the Python console trainer to be more like the C++/Java trainers
    * Update to the C++ trainer to compile when you try and run with Helicopter

===Fun Updates===

    * Colors added to tetris blocks. Each shape is now a different color!

===KNOWN BUGS===

    * The Real Time Strategy C/C++ Agent has a behavioral bug.  It will only build a base in the first episode.  We decided to put this release out with that problem in order to get all of the fixes out sooner. 





== Build 530 ==


===Boring Details===
    * Mountain Car observations are fixed
    * RL-Glue C/C++ Task Spec Parser doesn't crash when no reward range given (Helicopter)
    * /trainers/guiTrainerJava/bin/rlViz.jar is now the same version as the main gui trainer
    * Dynamic agent loader has been refactored
    * Dynamic environment loader has been refactored
    * Cleaned up and improved some of the frame and panel code in the visualizer
    * Visualizer rendering optimized a bit
    * The console trainers can now load Helicopter correctly
    * The console trainers take a variable for the MDP # for Helicopter
    * Can now build everything (except real time strategy) with $>make  instead of $>make all
    * Make clean now cleans compiled python files 


===Fun Details===    
    * Visualizer now runs in a window with the control components on that window
    * Save and load buttons in visualizer added (they call env_get_state and env_set_state)
    * Name/Description/Author/Url meta data added to environments and displayed in Viz
    * Under-the-hood support for agent visualization is done and working
    * Dynamic agent loader is working (not available to competitors... yet)
