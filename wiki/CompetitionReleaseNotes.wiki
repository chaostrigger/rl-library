= Notes Since B530 =

===Boring Details===
 * Vizualizer no longer crashes when there are no agents or environments when it starts up
 * Load button becomes disabled when no environments or agents
 * The speed slider/label only becomes enabled when an experiment is loaded

===Fun Details===
 * Colors added to tetris blocks. Each shape is now a different color!
 * Real Time Strategy environment can now be compiled and loaded as a dynamic C++ library
 * RTS java agent can now be loaded dynamically as a JAR, allowing local running of RTS experiments!
