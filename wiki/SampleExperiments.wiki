#summary Information about the sample experiments.

= Introduction =

There are currently two sample experiment projects, that can be found in:

  * `rl-library/projects/experiments/sampleExperimentRLGlue`
  * `rl-library/projects/experiments/sampleExperimentRLViz`

Each of these experiments can be run by going into the appropriate directory and running the bash script in there:

{{{
$> cd projects/experiments/sampleExperimentRLGlue
$> bash run.bash
}}}

Be sure that you have first built rl-glue in the main rl-library directory either by
{{{
$> make rl-glue
}}}

or
{{{
$> ant rl-glue
}}}


= Experiment Details =
Details about the experiments are in the README files in each experiment.  Basically, they each run a small number of episodes on an environment. The RL-Viz experiment can choose the environment and agent at runtime, by sending appropriate message the the environmentShell and the agentShell.
