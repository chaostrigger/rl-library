=== [BuildYourJavaProjectWithOurSystem Build Your Project] ===
This tutorial explains how you can setup a new project inside or outside of RL-Library (agent or environment) that uses the RL-Library build system.  Our build system makes it very easy to create RL-{Glue/Viz} compatible Jars that area easy to distribute and mix-and-match with RL-Library and other RL-Glue projects.
